# Analysis of AI Agent Behaviors in GitHub Pull Requests
# Project Overview
# This project is centered around the analysis of the AIDev dataset to understand the behavior and acceptance of AI coding agents in real-world GitHub development. The core methodology relies on data wrangling and statistical analysis of three key metadata categories: Agent Information, Repository Characteristics, and Pull Request Metadata. The primary deliverables are the findings for three research questions (RQs), which investigate the acceptance rate of AI-generated PRs across programming languages, the correlation between repository popularity and decision time, and the impact of PR description verbosity on merge likelihood. The analysis is supported by visualizations, including heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots, and density plots, to present the results.
# The project's code and analysis are available in a GitHub repository (https://github.com/Anita-Zeng/Milestone3-542-2025), which likely contains the data processing scripts (e.g., for filtering the top AI agents, calculating acceptance rates, and performing correlation analyses), the code for generating the figures referenced in the paper, and the final analytical findings. A key aspect of the project is its reliance on reproducible methods using publicly available metadata, though it notes a limitation regarding data issues in the RQ3 analysis. The overall conclusion emphasizes the universal technical acceptance of code from top AI agents and the critical importance of clear communication in PR descriptions for successful integration.
